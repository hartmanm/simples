If we build systems on systems, we rely on each system.
To trust our systems, must build them upon systems that are known to us.
To be reliable is not to avoid all errors, but to detect, identify, and recover from them.
A system that cannot, under some conditions; modify itself : cannot be reliable.
A isolated system cannot recover from errors as a complex network of systems can.
