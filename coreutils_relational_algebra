Split files by empty lines:
csplit —suppress-matched input.txt ‘/^$/‘ ‘{*}’
will output to x number of files 

On a line by line basis / will not work on fields:

union of files (with sorting)
sort -u <>  <> ...

Intersection of files (with sorting)
sort <>  <> ... | uniq -d

Difference of files (with sorting)
sort  <>  <> ... | uniq

Symmetric Difference of files (with sorting)
sort <>  <> ... | uniq -u

When files already sorted:

union of files (no sorting)
join -t ‘’ -a1-a2 <>  <> ...

Intersection of files (no sorting)
join -t ‘’ <>  <> ...

Difference of files (no sorting)
join -t ‘’ -v2 <>  <> ...

Symmetric Difference of files (no sorting)
join -t ‘’ -v1 -v2 <>  <> ...
